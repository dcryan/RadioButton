Radio Buttons
This is a small class that creates restyled radio buttons. The class returns a RadioButtons object which is a function pointer that you pass a data structure (defined later), and it returns a jQuery object of the radio buttons.

You can use the style sheet given or implement your own.

The data structure is of the form:

var data = 
[
	{text: "text1", value: value1},
	{text: "text2", value: value2}
];
